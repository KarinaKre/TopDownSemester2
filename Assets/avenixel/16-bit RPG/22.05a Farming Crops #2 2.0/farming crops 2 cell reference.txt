Hello! This text file is here to help you identify the crops included in this pack, and set them up in your game engine easily.

The Mana Seed Farming Crops sheets are arranged on a 144x512 pixel sheet, designed to be sliced at 16x32 pixels.
Each horizontal row has the following sprites for a single crop:

	Column 1) An inventory/shop icon for the crop.
	Column 2) An inventory/shop icon for the crop's seedbag.
	Column 3) Some seeds, for scattering on the ground when you plant them.
	Column 4) Stage 1 of the crop's growth.
	Column 5) Stage 2 of the crop's growth.
	Column 6) Stage 3 of the crop's growth.
	Column 7) Stage 4 of the crop's growth.
	Column 8) Stage 5 of the crop's growth.
	Column 9) An inventory/shop icon for the sign (see column 9).
	Column 10) Map object sign for the crop, so you know what you put in your garden.

They're all in this arrangement, so if you've got a system in your game for growing the crops, you can simply advance the frame by 1 for each stage (until 5).
You can also use the cell references below to quickly find the icons or signage by adding a certain value to the reference number.

After you plant the crops, they're meant to grow from stage 1 to 5 over whatever time you set.
For most crops, once it reaches stage 5 it's meant to be harvested, and then deleted from the environment.
But stage 4 and 5 need to be considered differently for some crops.
Some crops are designed to be harvested multiple times, in these cases, you still harvest it at stage 5, but...
... instead of deleting it from the environment, you reset it to stage 4, then move again to stage 5 the next day (or longer).
When you've given your player enough harvests, you can set it to eventually go away after harvesting stage 5.
The crops that work like this are visually identifiable by the fact that their stage 4 and 5 will be identical but for the absence/presence of harvestable vegetables.
Here's the list, though: bell peppers, blueberries, chili peppers, raspberries, eggplant, and zucchini.

Bell peppers (also known as paprika or capsicum) is a special case to the rule above.
Bell peppers should show stage 5 of the green variant first, then proceed to the yellow variant the next day, orange the day after, then finally red.
Harvesting at any stage will get you bell peppers of the appropriate color, and then start growing green ones again in a day or two.

Now for a cell reference guide to help you identify what the crops are meant to be.
There are 144 cells in each sheet, and I'm starting at cell 0 (so if your engine starts frames at cell 1, then just add 1 to all the references.

Note: I left some empty space on page B just in case I want to add more recolors in a future update.

One last note: The giant veggie on the "32x80" sheet is a zucchini.
I left empty space for more in a potential future update (and to match the sheet size of the giant veggies in Farming Crops #1).
I chose not to include recolors, but feel free to make your own using the recolors of the small one I provided on page B.
