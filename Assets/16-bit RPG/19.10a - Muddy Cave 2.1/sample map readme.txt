How to access the sample map:

Step 1) Download Tiled (for free) here:
https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled

Step 2) Install Tiled.

Step 3) Put the sample map TMX file in the same folder as the muddy cave tileset PNGs.

Step 4) Open the sample map!



The sample map will show you how I setup my terrain brushes and animation timing,
as well as give you some insight into how I arrange layers and creatively use the transparent shadow tiles.
This is only meant to be a helpful usage guide, and you are free to use the tileset any way you see fit.

Thanks!
